# OblivionOS Kernel Environment

## Overview

OblivionOS Kernel Environment is a sovereign kernel inspired by the Linux kernel, written in Rust. This project aims to provide a secure, efficient, and modern operating system kernel that leverages the safety and performance benefits of the Rust programming language.

## Features

- **Safety**: Rust's ownership model and type system ensure memory safety and prevent common bugs.
- **Performance**: Rust's zero-cost abstractions and efficient memory management contribute to high performance.
- **Modularity**: The kernel is designed with modularity in mind, allowing for easy extension and customization.
- **Security**: Built-in security features to protect against vulnerabilities and ensure data integrity.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Rust toolchain (nightly)
- Cargo (Rust's package manager)
- QEMU (for emulation and testing)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/OblivionOS/kernel.git
    cd kernel
    ```

2. **Build the kernel**:
    ```sh
    cargo build --release
    ```

3. **Run the kernel in QEMU**:
    ```sh
    cargo run
    ```
